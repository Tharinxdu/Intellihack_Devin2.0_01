# Intellihack_Devin2.0_01

## Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model for recommending the best crops based on environmental conditions and nutrient levels. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the most suitable crops for cultivation given input features such as temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) levels.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation contains information about crops, including their nutrient levels (N, P, K), environmental factors (temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall), and corresponding labels indicating the crop type.

### Features:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH
- Rainfall
- Nitrogen (N) level
- Phosphorus (P) level
- Potassium (K) level

### Labels:
- Crop type (e.g., Wheat, Rice, Maize, etc.)

## Getting Started
To run the code and reproduce the results:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-recommendation.git
cd crop-recommendation
