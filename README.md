# Intellihack_Devin2.0_01

## Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model for recommending the best crops based on environmental conditions and nutrient levels. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the most suitable crops for cultivation given input features such as temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) levels.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation contains information about crops, including their nutrient levels (N, P, K), environmental factors (temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall), and corresponding labels indicating the crop type.

### Features:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH
- Rainfall
- Nitrogen (N) level
- Phosphorus (P) level
- Potassium (K) level

### Labels:
- Crop type (e.g., Wheat, Rice, Maize, etc.)

## Getting Started
To run the code and reproduce the results:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-recommendation.git
cd crop-recommendation
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the dataset (if not included) and place it in the `data/` directory.

4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model and make predictions:

```
jupyter notebook crop_recommendation.ipynb
```

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score metrics, depending on the classification task. Cross-validation or holdout datasets may be used for evaluation to assess the model's generalization ability.

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99% on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in recommending suitable crops based on input conditions.
